# Simple-Hotel-Management
Hotel Management System is a Java-based, menu-driven application that manages room bookings, customer data, food orders, billing, and persists hotel status using file handling, with robust exception handling and support for multi-threaded file operations.​


The topics covered include the use of classes and objects, inheritance for code reuse and hierarchical design, file handling with object serialization for data persistence, dynamic data management using ArrayList, implementing interfaces to define contracts for classes, creating custom user-defined exceptions, and robust exception handling to manage runtime errors effectively.
